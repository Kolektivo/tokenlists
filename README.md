# Kolektivo Token List
## Overview
This repository contains all the references and identifiers of the tokens used by other parts of the stack in the Kolektivo Framework.

The Kolektivo Network Token (KNT) bridges liquidity between trading pairs and community economies in Kolektivo’s broader ecosystem. It ultimately facilitates exchange between the many assets that the Kolektivo Framework will produce and support, such as ecological assets, community currencies, and local reserve tokens. KNT affords certain network governance rights.

The Kolektivo Treasury Token (KTT)  is used to bootstrap local reserves and their corresponding community economies. It is an elastic supply token based on the total value of assets in the Kolektivo Network Treasury. For example, if there are $100m worth of assets in the Treasury, and KTT aims to be priced at $1, then its supply will change — what is known as rebasing — to 100m.

The Kolektivo Curacao Reserve Token (kCUR) is used as collateral in the Mento system to mint the community currency. It is backed by the Reserve’s assets, such as KTT, Ecological Tokens or LP Tokens. kCUR’s parameters, such as leverage, price ceilings and floors, are customizable through community governance.

The Kolektivo Guilder (kG) is the community currency of Kolektivo Curaçao, used by the Curaçaoan population for daily exchange. kG is pegged to the national fiat currency (Guilder) and collateralized by kCUR in the Mento system.

Ecological Tokens are fungible shards of a Geospatial Non-Fungible Token. A shard is produced when an NFT is split into multiple tokens. Ecological tokens are a key asset class backing community reserves and currencies. Ecological tokens have four potential use cases that bind them to the territories they represent: as datatokens, insurance tokens, outputs-rights tokens, and ownership tokens. Some of their market characteristics such as supply are correlated to topological or ecological parameters, linking these tokens to the underlying material reality.

Liquidity Pool Tokens (LP Tokens) are a representation of the existing assets in a Liquidity Pool — a sort of index with member tokens. LP Tokens are issued to liquidity providers in exchange for their participation in the liquidity pool. For example, a liquidity provider who deposits KNT and kCUR in a two-asset pool will generally receive [50% KNT / 50% kCUR] LP Tokens proportional to their share of the pool, as well as a proportional distribution of trading fees collected by the pool.
